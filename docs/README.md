# Firefox Website Builder

A frictionless WYSIWYG web page builder integrated into Firefox, with one-click cloud hosting.

### Goal: Empower users to create & publish web pages in Firefox as easily as they currently consume web pages in Firefox.

- Self-publish without relying on a corporate content silo like FB, Medium, Github Pages
- Share personal photos and conversations without also sharing with FB or Google
- Democratize web tech by making it easy to get started & providing paths to learn more

### Secondary goal: Give Mozilla a venue to test out new products at the intersection of improving life on the web, nudging big players to do better, and potentially making money.

Examples:
- Web infrastructure: ethical display ads, privacy-preserving user analytics.
- Indie alternatives to web content silos: offer Mozilla-curated chat, photo-sharing, blogging webapps that users can share publicly or privately.
- Paid placements (search deal style): default cloud hosting provider, paid/curated placement in the marketplace.

Building this kind of project will both depend on Mozilla’s community and would help to build that community. Growing our community isn’t explicitly a goal, but our success depends on it.

# Potential Features:

- Website Builder
- Cloud Hosting
- Marketplace for web designs and unhosted web apps
- Community Chat
- Ethical Mozilla-powered ad network
- Ethical Mozilla-powered analytics

## Website Builder
MVP: Open a new tab to a blank page with a theme picker and fill it in. The idea is to blur the line between taking notes and making websites. Inspiration: Hypercard, Firefox Notes, Microsoft Frontpage, Github Pages builder. Really basic static pages. Big red button to publish to the web.

Version 2: More elaborate toolkit with components like image upload/editor, or a chat / webrtc video chat component, or a WebVR page builder. Could also grow into a set of web authoring toolkits available for purchase. We’ll also need a sort of top-level page where users can access both stuff they create (their draft pages, unpublished and published websites), as well as stuff they’ve bought.

## Cloud Hosting
MVP: User pushes a big red button to push a static page to some Mozilla-powered domain.
Would it be interesting to also allow a web page to be sent via Send? This would be easy for an MVP, and also blurs the line between a message/doc and a website.

Version 2: Cloud hosting on user’s choice of service, subsidized by paid default hosting placement and ethical display ads.

## Marketplace for web designs and unhosted web apps
MVP: AMO-style website for picking new “themes” for the built-in page layout.
Click to add to your list of installed themes, then go to your web pages and apply the new theme.

Version 2: buying, selling, sharing all kinds of web content. Payments via FxA.
buying/selling more elaborate webapps (federated private Facebook or Twitter clones, or private chat rooms, or a self-hosted ecommerce site)
buying/subscribing to a series of webdev how-to videos (Mozilla Developer Relations content?)
collaboratively sharing K-12 web tech lesson plans

## Community Chat
MVP: Simple landing page with link to Discourse community chat

Version 2: Nicer landing page with that gathers Mozilla-curated content about building and teaching the web, and specific community pages with chat, helpful links and info, for different communities (web dev learning community, customer service for WMO buyers/sellers, resources for educators).

## Ethical Mozilla-powered ad network
MVP: No ads, or Pocket recs as display ads.

Version 2: Privacy-preserving ad targeting to create a more ethical ad network.

## Ethical Mozilla-powered analytics
MVP: Basic info about traffic to a page (number of visitors, times, referrer info)

Version 2: Richer analytics offering: allow pages to fire pings when interactions happen; add a dashboard builder.
